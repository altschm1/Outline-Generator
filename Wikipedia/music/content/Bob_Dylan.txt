'''Bob Dylan'''<!-- Subjects are introduced by their legal name --> (born '''Robert Allen Zimmerman''', May 24, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter, author, and visual artist who has been a major figure in popular culture for six decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]" (1963) and "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]" (1964) became anthems for the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war movement]]. His lyrics incorporated a wide range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defied existing conventions of [[popular music]], and appealed to the burgeoning [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], such as on the six-minute single "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]" (1965). Following [[Bob Dylan (album)|his self-titled debut album]] in 1962, which mainly consisted of traditional folk songs, Dylan made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of the 1963 album ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'', featuring "Blowin' in the Wind" and the thematically complex composition "[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]". For many of these songs he adapted the tunes and sometimes phraseology of older folk songs. Dylan went on to release the politically charged ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]'' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective ''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]'' in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan [[Electric Dylan controversy|encountered controversy]] when he adopted the use of [[Amplifier|electrically amplified]] [[Rock music|rock]] instrumentation and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s, ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'' (1965), ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'' (1965), and ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' (1966). In July 1966, Dylan withdrew from touring after being injured in a motorcycle accident. During this period he recorded [[List of Basement Tapes songs|a large body of songs]] with members of [[the Band]], who had previously backed Dylan on tour; later released as the collaborative album ''[[The Basement Tapes]]'' in 1975. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored country music and rural themes in ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'' (1967), ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' (1969), and ''[[New Morning]]'' (1970). In 1975 Dylan released the album ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'', which many saw as a return to form, followed by ''[[Desire (Bob Dylan album)|Desire]]'' (1976). In the late 1970s, Dylan became a [[Born again|born-again Christian]] and released a series of albums of contemporary gospel music before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s. Dylan's major works during his later career include ''[[Time Out of Mind (album)|Time Out of Mind]]'' (1997), ''[[Love and Theft (Bob Dylan album)|"Love and Theft"]]'' (2001), and ''[[Tempest (Bob Dylan album)|Tempest]]'' (2012). His most recent recordings have comprised versions of traditional American standards, especially songs recorded by [[Frank Sinatra]]. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed "the [[Never Ending Tour]]". Since 1994, Dylan has published eight books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. Dylan has sold more than 100&nbsp;million records, making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]]. He has also received [[List of awards received by Bob Dylan|numerous awards]] including ten [[Grammy Award]]s, a [[Golden Globe Award]], and an [[Academy Award]]. Dylan has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], [[Minnesota Music Hall of Fame]], [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. The [[Pulitzer Prize]] jury in 2008 awarded him a [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|special citation]] for "his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power". In 2012, Dylan received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], and in 2016, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] "for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition".<ref name =NobelCite/> ==Life and career== ===1941–1959: Origins and musical beginnings=== [[File:ZimmermanHouseHibbingMN.jpg|thumb|left|The Zimmerman family home in Hibbing, Minnesota]] Bob Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman ([[Hebrew]] name {{lang|he|שבתאי זיסל בן אברהם}} [Shabtai Zisl ben Avraham])<ref>Sounes, p. 14, gives his Hebrew name as Shabtai Zisel ben Avraham</ref><ref>A [[Chabad]] news service gives the variant Zushe ben Avraham, which may be a [[Yiddish]] variant {{cite web | url = http://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/573406/jewish/SingerSongwriter-Bob-Dylan-Joins-Yom-Kippur-Services-in-Atlanta.htm | title = Singer/Songwriter Bob Dylan Joins Yom Kippur Services in Atlanta | date = September 24, 2007 | accessdate=September 11, 2008 | publisher=Chabad.org News }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.aish.com/ci/a/Bob-Dylans-Jewish-Odyssey.html|title=Bob Dylan's Jewish Odyssey|last=Preskovsky|first=Ilan|date=March 12, 2016|work=Aish.com|access-date=May 20, 2018|language=}}</ref> in St. Mary's Hospital on May 24, 1941, in [[Duluth, Minnesota]],<ref>Sounes, p. 14</ref><ref name=mnbirth>{{cite web|url=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?ti=0&indiv=try&db=mnbirth&h=9920599|title=Robert Allen Zimmerman|work=Minnesota Birth Index, 1935–2002|publisher=Ancestry.com|quote=Name: Robert Allen Zimmerman; Birth Date: May 24, 1941; Birth County: Saint Louis; Father: Abram H.

Shelton surmises that Dillon had two sources: [[Matt Dillon (Gunsmoke)|Marshal Matt Dillon]] was the hero of the TV western ''[[Gunsmoke]]''; Dillon was also the name of one of Hibbing's principal families. While Shelton was writing Dylan's biography in the 1960s, Dylan told him, "Straighten out in your book that I did not take my name from Dylan Thomas. Dylan Thomas's poetry is for people that aren't really satisfied in their bed, for people who dig masculine romance." At the University of Minnesota, the singer told a few friends that Dillon was his mother's maiden name, which was untrue. He later told reporters that he had an uncle named Dillon. Shelton added that only when he reached New York in 1961 did the singer begin to spell his name "Dylan", by which time he was acquainted with the life and work of Dylan Thomas. Shelton (2011), pp. 44–45.</ref> In his memoir, he said he hit upon using this less common variant for ''Dillon'' – a surname he had considered adopting – when he unexpectedly saw poems by [[Dylan Thomas]].<ref>Dylan, pp. 78–79.</ref> Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview, he said, "You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens. You call yourself what you want to call yourself. This is the land of the free."<ref name = "60minutes2005"/> ===1960s=== ====Relocation to New York and record deal==== In May 1960, Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year. In January 1961, he traveled to New York City to perform there and visit his musical idol [[Woody Guthrie]],<ref>Sounes, p. 72</ref> who was seriously ill with [[Huntington's disease]] in [[Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital]].<ref>Dylan, p. 98.</ref> Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and influenced his early performances. Describing Guthrie's impact, he wrote: "The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them... [He] was the true voice of the American spirit. I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie's greatest disciple."<ref>Dylan, pp. 244–246.</ref> As well as visiting Guthrie in hospital, Dylan befriended Guthrie's protégé [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]]. Much of Guthrie's repertoire was channeled through Elliott, and Dylan paid tribute to Elliott in ''[[Chronicles: Volume One]]''.<ref>Dylan, pp. 250–252.</ref> From February 1961, Dylan played at clubs around [[Greenwich Village]], befriending and picking up material from folk singers there, including [[Dave Van&nbsp;Ronk]], [[Fred Neil]], [[Odetta]], the [[New Lost City Ramblers]] and Irish musicians [[The Clancy Brothers|the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]].<ref>Shelton (2011), pp. 74–78.</ref> On April 11, Dylan commenced a two-week engagement at [[Gerde's Folk City]], supporting [[John Lee Hooker]].<ref>Heylin, 1996, ''Bob Dylan: A Life In Stolen Moments'', p. 35.</ref> ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] first noted Dylan in a review of [[Izzy Young]]'s production for [[WLTW#History|WRVR]] of a live twelve-hour Hootenanny on July 29, 1961: "Among the newer promising talents deserving mention are a 20-year-old latter-day Guthrie disciple named Bob Dylan, with a curiously arresting mumbling, country-steeped manner".

Once in a while I would have to rise up and offer myself for an interview so they wouldn't beat the door down.

During rehearsals, Dylan had been told by [[CBS]] television's head of program practices that "[[Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues]]" was potentially libelous to the [[John Birch Society]]. Rather than comply with censorship, Dylan refused to appear.<ref>Dylan had recorded "Talkin' John Birch Society Blues" for his [[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan|''Freewheelin'']] album, but the song was replaced by later compositions, including "[[Masters of War]]". See Heylin (2000), pp. 114–115.</ref> By this time, Dylan and Baez were prominent in the civil rights movement, singing together at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] on August 28, 1963.<ref>Dylan performed "[[Only a Pawn in Their Game]]" and "[[When the Ship Comes In]]"; see Heylin (1996), p. 49.</ref> Dylan's third album, ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (album)|The Times They Are a-Changin'<nowiki/>]]'', reflected a more politicized Dylan.<ref>Gill, pp. 37–41.</ref> The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary stories, with "[[Only a Pawn in Their Game]]" addressing the murder of civil rights worker [[Medgar Evers]]; and the [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] "[[The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll]]" the death of black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll, at the hands of young white socialite William Zantzinger.<ref>Ricks, pp. 221–233.</ref> On a more general theme, "[[Ballad of Hollis Brown]]" and "[[North Country Blues]]" addressed despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities. This political material was accompanied by two personal love songs, "Boots of Spanish Leather" and "[[One Too Many Mornings]]".<ref>Williams, p. 56.</ref> By the end of 1963, Dylan felt both manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements.<ref>Shelton, pp. 200–205.</ref> Accepting the "[[Thomas Paine|Tom Paine]] Award" from the [[National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee]] shortly after the assassination of [[John F.

"[[It Ain't Me Babe]]", on the surface a song about spurned love, has been described as a rejection of the role of political spokesman thrust upon him.<ref>Shelton, p. 222.</ref> His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the [[impressionism|impressionistic]] "[[Chimes of Freedom (song)|Chimes of Freedom]]", which sets [[social commentary]] against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by [[Allen Ginsberg]] as "chains of flashing images,"<ref>In an interview with Seth Goddard for ''Life'' (July 5, 2001) Ginsberg said Dylan's technique had been inspired by [[Jack Kerouac]]: "(Dylan) pulled ''[[Mexico City Blues]]'' from my hand and started reading it and I said, 'What do you know about that?' He said, 'Somebody handed it to me in '59 in St. Paul and it blew my mind.' So I said 'Why?' He said, 'It was the first poetry that spoke to me in my own language.' So those chains of flashing images you get in Dylan, like 'the motorcycle black Madonna two-wheeled gypsy queen and her silver studded phantom lover,' they're influenced by Kerouac's chains of flashing images and spontaneous writing, and that spreads out into the people."
